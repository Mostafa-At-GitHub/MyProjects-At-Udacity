### [Project Script Code Preview](my%20local%20solution.py)

### [1st Project](https://github.com/Mostafa-At-GitHub/MyProjects-At-Udacity/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20Nanodegree/2.%20Professional%20Track/1st%20proj%20-%20%20Explore%20US%20Bikeshare%20Data/my%20local%20solution.py), tasks short description

- The project was for writing a Python script to enable the user to do analysis on Bikeshare system data for cities; Chicago, New York City, and Washington, from their respective [three data sets](bikeshare-datasets), and to answer questions about: Popular times of travel , Popular stations and trip, Trip duration and User info.

- Great work on the project till now. Youâ€™ve worked hard on the project and it clearly shows. 
- Everything runs free of errors. Nicely done! ðŸŒŸ
- You have appropriately used lists and dataframes to carry out the analysis tasks. Reading everything into a
Pandas dataframe is one of the best first steps in making your data analysis project a success. You have
done well here. ðŸŒŸ
- Loops and conditionals are appropriately used to process user input and calculate the statistics. ðŸŒŸ
- Pandas is a great choice for solving this project! Great work on implementing its functionality to work out
the statistics! ðŸŒŸ
- You have appropriately used docstrings and comments, and your variable names help understand the kind
of data being stored in that variable. ðŸŒŸ
- Raw input is correctly handled including case-sensitivity. No errors are thrown on unexpected
inputs. ðŸŒŸ
- Great job calculating all the statistics correctly.

- Thank you so much for paying such attention to detail when Ã•xing the minor comments made during previous review. The project looks
amazing now :)
- The script is neatly written and runs with great computational eÃžciency. What really stands out is the readability of your code -
everything from comments to spacing (this is such an important trait to have as a programmer). It was a pleasure to read through it.
- Really awesome work!
- Please keep up the good work and happy learning ahead!
