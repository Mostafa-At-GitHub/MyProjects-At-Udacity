     ##### [1<sup>st</sup> project - Explore US Bikeshare Data](https://cutt.ly/1st-proj---Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data "A Python script to enable the user to do analysis on one of three data sets") *A Python script to enable the user to do analysis on one of three data sets*
    *"The script is neatly written and runs with great computational efficiency. What really stands out is the readability of your code - everything from comments to spacing (this is such an important trait to have as a programmer). It was a pleasure to read through it. Really awesome work!. You’ve worked hard on the project and it clearly shows. Everything runs free of errors. Nicely done! 🌟 You have appropriately used lists and dataframes to carry out the analysis tasks. 🌟 Loops and conditionals are appropriately used to process user input and calculate the statistics. 🌟 You have appropriately used docstrings and comments, and your variable names help understand the kind of data being stored in that variable. 🌟 Raw input is correctly handled including case-sensitivity. No errors are thrown on unexpected inputs. 🌟 Great job calculating all the statistics correctly......[Read full reviews](https://cutt.ly/1st-proj---Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data-reviews-highlights)"*
