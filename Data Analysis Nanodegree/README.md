     ##### [1st project - Explore US Bikeshare Data](https://cutt.ly/1st-proj---Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data "A Python script to enable the user to do analysis on one of three data sets") *A Python script to enable the user to do analysis on one of three data sets*
    *"The script is neatly written and runs with great computational efficiency. What really stands out is the readability of your code - everything from comments to spacing (this is such an important trait to have as a programmer). It was a pleasure to read through it. Really awesome work!. Youâ€™ve worked hard on the project and it clearly shows. Everything runs free of errors. Nicely done! ðŸŒŸ You have appropriately used lists and dataframes to carry out the analysis tasks. ðŸŒŸ Loops and conditionals are appropriately used to process user input and calculate the statistics. ðŸŒŸ You have appropriately used docstrings and comments, and your variable names help understand the kind of data being stored in that variable. ðŸŒŸ Raw input is correctly handled including case-sensitivity. No errors are thrown on unexpected inputs. ðŸŒŸ Great job calculating all the statistics correctly......[Read full reviews](https://cutt.ly/1st-proj---Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data-reviews-highlights)"*
