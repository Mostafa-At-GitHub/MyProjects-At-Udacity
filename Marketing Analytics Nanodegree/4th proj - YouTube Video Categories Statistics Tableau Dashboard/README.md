### [4th Project](https://cutt.ly/4th-Project-Build-Data-Dashboards---YouTube-Video-Categories-Statistics-modded_Presentation-Preview), tasks short description
- The project was for making a Tableau dashboard with storytelling from 3 choices as follows:

  - Flight Delays and Cancellations
  - US Census Demographic Data
  - Youtube Data from the US

  I set out to make all three, finally, I completed the work for a story from [three CSV files data sets](https://cutt.ly/4th-Project-Build-Data-Dashboards---YouTube-Video-Categories-Statistics_XSLX-Workbooks) collected using YouTube API, backed by [my dashboard and sheets for youtube vedio categories viewed in the American States from the start of Nov 14, 2017, to the end of March 20, 2018](https://cutt.ly/4th-Project-Build-Data-Dashboards---YouTube-Video-Categories-Statistics_Tableau-Dashboard).

- Attached [my presentation work](https://cutt.ly/4th-Project-Build-Data-Dashboards---YouTube-Video-Categories-Statistics-modded_Presentation-Preview), and the data sets are in the folder named '[youtubedata - XLSX files](https://cutt.ly/4th-Project-Build-Data-Dashboards---YouTube-Video-Categories-Statistics_XSLX-Workbooks)'.
