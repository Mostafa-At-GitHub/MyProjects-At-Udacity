### [4th Project](https://github.com/Mostafa-At-GitHub/Udacity-Marketing-Analytics-Nanodegree_-_MyProjects/blob/main/4th%20proj%20-%20YouTube%20Video%20Categories%20Statistics%20Tableau%20Dashboard/4TH%20PROJECT%20Build%20Data%20Dashboards%20-%20YouTube%20Video%20Categories%20Statistics%20modded.pdf), tasks short description
- The project was for making a Tableau dashboard with storytelling from 3 choices as follows:

  - Flight Delays and Cancellations
  - US Census Demographic Data
  - Youtube Data from the US

  I set out to make all three, finally, I completed the work for a story from three CSV files data sets collected using YouTube API backed by a dashboard and sheets for youtube vedio categories viewed in the American States from the start of Nov 14, 2017, to the end of March 20, 2018.

- Attached my presentation work, and the data sets are in the folder named '[youtubedata - XLSX files](https://github.com/Mostafa-At-GitHub/Udacity-Marketing-Analytics-Nanodegree_-_MyProjects/tree/main/4th%20proj%20-%20YouTube%20Video%20Categories%20Statistics%20Tableau%20Dashboard/youtubedata%20-%20XLSX%20files)'.
