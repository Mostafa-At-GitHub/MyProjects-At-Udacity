### 4th Project, tasks short description
- The project was for making a Tableau dashboard with storytelling from 3 choices as follows:

  - Flight Delays and Cancellations
  - US Census Demographic Data
  - Youtube Data from the US

  I set out to make all three, finally, I completed the work for a story from three CSV files data sets collected using YouTube API backed by a dashboard and sheets for youtube vedio categories viewed in the American States from the start of Nov 14, 2017, to the end of March 20, 2018.

- Attached my presentation work, and the data sets are in the folder named 'youtubedata - XLSX files'.

polished your work before submission.

- Well done formatting your insights in short points to add some structure to your insights. Rather than having
to scan through the whole text for particular info, any interested reader can easily focus on a particular
section of each insight you uncovered.
