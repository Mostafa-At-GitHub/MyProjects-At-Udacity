Great job adding a descriptive heading for each insight. This not only neatly demarcates your insights, but
also gives your readers a heads up on what you're going to be talking about.

You drew some good, air-tight conclusions from your analysis. You also presented ample data, facts and other
information from the dashboard to back your ’ndings. Terri’c! :)

Your screenshots appropriately illustrate the written part of your response. Excellent!
